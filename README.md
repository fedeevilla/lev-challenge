## Deploy üì¶

I've decided to use Netlify because it has a simple Installation and Configuration flow. Netlify allows us that on every commit into `main` a new deploy runs upgrading the Site page. Also it provides us Preview Deploys, like the followings:

- First-day work: https://deploy-preview-1--lev-challenge.netlify.app/
- Live demo on: https://lev-challenge.netlify.app/
